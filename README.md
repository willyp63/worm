### Implementation

Worm is written in Vanilla JavaScript (No JQuery!). The code is split into several modules and bundled using Webpack. Rendering of the game is done with HTML5 Canvas. 3D CSS transitions are utilized to give the game an engaging interface.

### Description

Worm is a fresh new take on the classic arcade game Snake. The objective remains the same. Eat and grow as large as you can while avoiding running into yourself or a wall.
